Remember: the main goal is creaminess.","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Ian Fisher"},"image":"https://static01.nyt.com/images/2021/02/14/dining/carbonara-horizontal/carbonara-horizontal-mediumThreeByTwo440-v2.jpg","totalTime":"PT25M","recipeYield":"4 servings","recipeCuisine":"italian","recipeCategory":"dinner, easy, quick, pastas, main course","keywords":"cheese, pancetta, pasta","aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingValue":5,"ratingCount":6681},"nutrition":{"@context":"http://schema.org","@type":"NutritionInformation","calories":513,"unsaturatedFatContent":"11 grams","carbohydrateContent":"64 grams","cholesterolContent":null,"fatContent":"19 grams","fiberContent":"3 grams","proteinContent":"20 grams","saturatedFatContent":"6 grams","sodiumContent":"339 milligrams","sugarContent":"3 grams","transFatContent":"0 grams"},"recipeIngredient":["Salt","2 large eggs and 2 large yolks, room temperature","1 ounce (about 1/3 packed cup) grated pecorino Romano, plus additional for serving","1 ounce (about 1/3 packed cup) grated Parmesan","Coarsely ground black pepper","1 tablespoon olive oil","3 1/2 ounces of slab guanciale (see \u003ca href=\"http://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1014345-shortcut-guanciale\"\u003erecipe\u003c/a\u003e), pancetta or bacon, sliced into pieces about 1/4 inch thick by 1/3 inch square","12 ounces spaghetti (about 3/4 box)"],"recipeInstructions":[{"@context":"http://schema.org","@type":"HowToStep","text":"Place a large pot of lightly salted water (no more than 1 tablespoon salt) over high heat, and bring to a boil.
